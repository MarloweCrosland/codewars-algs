<!-- Time complexity
Relationship between N (length of input) and time to execute
Examples
O(k) or O(1) -> constant time
O(logn) -> logarithmic time
O(n) -> linear time
O(nlogn)
O(n^2) -> quadratic time
O(2^n) -> exponential time

Quick note on logarithms
if x^y = z, then log (base z) of y = x
For example, base 2: 2^6 = 64, then log (base 2) 64 = 6 -->
